Sliced, the home of the true pizza slice, is based on a Scrimba frontend career path solo project for module 5 "Essential JS". I have added my own styling to it, with am Illustrator custom-made logo.

Stack: HTML / JavaScript / CSS
Functionalities:
 - clicking the + icon adds the item to the cart and displays the cart
 - multiple copies of the same item render on the same line with an X multiplier
 - item cost and total cost are updated upon each added item
 - clicking the PAY button brings up a fake credit card payment modal.
 
 Key concepts used:
 - data attributes and click handlers to manage adding and deleting items
 - mapping over an array of data for generating an HTML string
 - separation of concerns with using separate functions for data handling, HTML generation and rendering
 - form validation
